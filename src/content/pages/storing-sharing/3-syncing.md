The Earth Defenders Toolkit device also comes bundled with an application to synchronize files between two or more computers and mobile devices.

<app-button :color="true" target="_self" link="apps/syncthing" text="Download Syncthing"></app-button>

<app-button localUrl=":8082" text="Use Syncthing"></app-button>

You can use it to backup important data from your computer or phone to the Offline Toolkit device, or sync the latest content from the <app-button :inline="true" localUrl=":8086/">Earth Defenders Toolkit Cloud</app-button> to your device, whenever Internet is available.

This application is protected and to be used only by project coordinators.
