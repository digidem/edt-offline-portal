The Earth Defenders Toolkit device also comes bundled with an application to synchronize files between two or more computers and mobile devices.

You can use it to backup important data from your computer or phone to the Offline Toolkit device, or sync the latest content from the <app-button :inline="true" localUrl=":8086/">Earth Defenders Toolkit Cloud</app-button> to your device, whenever Internet is available.

This application is protected and to be used only by project coordinators.
