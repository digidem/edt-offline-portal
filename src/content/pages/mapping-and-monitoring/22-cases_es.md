We invite you to read the story of two communities who have used digital mapping tools to defend their territories: The Waorani people of Ecuador, and in Peru the indigenous organization defending the ECA-Amarakaeri. Through their journey you'll learn about **Mapeo** and how it can be used for community mapping projects, and see if it's the right tool for your community.
