We provide a Mapeo instance on the device running Earth Defenders Toolkit Offline. You can sync with it when connected to it's WiFi hotspot, and use it as an additional storage for mapping data, or as a central hub for gathering mapping data for the monitoring team.

If you changed your Mapeo configuration, you might need to change the `MAPEO_PROJECT_KEY` variable for your Earth Defenders Toolkit Offline instance. Check our documentation to learn more.
