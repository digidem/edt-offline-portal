Like Mapeo, [Terrastories](/geo-storytelling) is another powerful mapping tool stewarded by Digital Democracy. Both tools are being used by some of our partners, but there's no easy way to get data from Mapeo on a mobile device to Terrastories.

For that reason the [Mapeo Data Hub](#mapeo-data-hub) automatically exports the observations of type `Terrastories` as a zip file, which can be imported into Terrastories as Places for stories. Check the **Terrastories documentation** to learn more about importing.
