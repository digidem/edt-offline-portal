Much of Mapeo is customizable in terms of language, maps and information you collect. When you download it, it comes with a default configuration which you can use immediately to collect information about threats to land or rights.

The configuration can be customized, so we provide a few customized configuration files that might better serve the needs of your community mapping project or at least serve as inspiration for further customization. Read the <app-button :inline="true" :color="true" localUrl=":8086/all/docs.mapeo.app">Mapeo documentation</app-button> to learn how to load the configuration files.

The default configuration files come ready to be used to sync with the [Mapeo Data Hub](/mapping-and-monitoring#mapeo-data-hub).
