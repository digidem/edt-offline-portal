We provide a Mapeo instance with the Offline Toolkit . You can sync with it when connected to it's WiFi hotspot, and use it as an additional storage for mapping data, or as a central hub for gathering mapping data for the monitoring team.

If you changed your Mapeo configuration, you might need to change the `MAPEO_PROJECT_KEY` variable for your Offline Toolkit instance on the <app-button :inline="true" localUrl=":8079/#/configuration">admin panel</app-button>. Check our documentation to learn more.
