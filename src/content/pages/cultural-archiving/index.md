Āhau is a community archiving platform designed by the Māori people of Aotearoa New Zealand for sharing and preserving culture and identity. It helps tribal and family communities capture, preserve, and share important information, histories and media into digital archives and collections that are stored on community-run hardware.

If you are part of a tribe, a family group, or a community that wants to keep a record of its members, their histories and connections, or if you want to create a shared archive to preserve and share your community’s stories and cultural practices in digital form, then Ahau could be a good tool for you.
