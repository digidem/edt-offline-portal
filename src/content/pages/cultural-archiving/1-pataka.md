One piece of infrastructure required to onboard your community to Ä€hau is a community database server. This device is running the Pataka application.

After opening the application you will be prompted to create a personal profile and connect to a Pataka. This is your Kakawa device. This will sync an encrypted copy of your database with the community server and enable sharing information with other community members.
