Like Terrastories, [Mapeo](/mapping-and-monitoring) is another powerful mapping tool stewarded by Digital Democracy. The easiest way to start collecting geolocations and referencing them to stories is by using Mapeo and the [Mapeo Data Hub](/mapping-and-monitoring#mapeo-data-hub).

After syncing with the Hub, it automatically exports the observations of type `Terrastories` as a zip file, which can be imported into Terrastories as Places for stories.
