Just as a community might come together to build a water supply system, they can also organize to create a community communication infrastructure, known as a Community Network. A network designed to share communication resources focusing on the needs and wishes of the community.

Libremesh and Librerouter are tools that facilitate the creation and management of Community Networks.
