Storytelling is essential for maintaining communitiesâ€™ cultural identity and
their relationship to ancestral landscapes. In many cases these histories are passed down from generation to generation through the spoken word.

Terrastories is a geostorytelling application built to enable communities to locate and map their own oral storytelling traditions about places of significant meaning or value to them.
