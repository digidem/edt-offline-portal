This Offline Toolkit provides a file management interface that can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. It allows the creation of multiple users and every user can create directories on a digital community space.

All user data is open to be viewed and edited by every other user, so be sure to follow some basic guide-lines on using a shared digital space.
