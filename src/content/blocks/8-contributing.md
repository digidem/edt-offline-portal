### Support starting a project

Digital Democracy's core team is very small and we have limited capacity to provide direct accompaniment for implementing Earth Defenders Toolkit Offline outside of our existing partnerships. In some cases we are able to offer support. To read more about the way we work with partners and different levels of support, read our **partner protocol**.
